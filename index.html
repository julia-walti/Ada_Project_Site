							<h2> Context </h2>
							<p>The movie industry today is a caucasian man’s world but things are changing. There has been a debate in recent years whether cultural minorities 
								have been invisibilized in occidental cultural works, especially in American cinema. Moreover, with the rise of the MeToo movement and feminism in general, 
								the place of women in this industry has also been debated. Indeed, both these groups are often portrayed as stereotypical secondary characters and most 
								successful movies are often not portraying stories about these groups. Also, they are noticeably absent from the crews. 
								<a href="https://womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/the-history-and-future-of-women-in-film">[1]</a>
								<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/female-representation-in-movies-has-barely-changed-in-a-decade-but-theres-a-way-we-can-fix-it-9940849">[2]</a> 
								<a href="https://impakter.com/minority-recognition-in-film-where-is-the-diversity/">[3]</a>
								Hence, the place of minorities and women in movies will be studied in this project. This will be done in terms of presence, representation and success by 
								looking at actors, characters and crew members. With this, a timeline of the integration of these groups in the industry will be created, with which a time-series 
								analysis will be performed. It must be noted that the dataset used goes to the year 2013, and as many changes have been put in place since then, some might be
								missed as they happened recently. Moreover, during this project, gender will be looked as binary as it represented this way in the dataset.</p>

						<h2>Proportion of women in the crew </h2>
						<p>Next, let’s look at the proportion of women writers and directors. There are a lot of directors and writers for one movie. In the dataset used, 94, 02 % of movies were directed and 95,80 % written by only men. There were no movies that were written or directed by only women. If we merge the crew information, there are 7,78 % movies that have at least one woman in the crew.
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/13/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>Thus, with no surprise, the distributions of movies created by only men or by a crew containing at least one women are significantly different (Mann-Whitney p-value of 5e-20). Moreover, even if the proportion of women in movie crews has change since the 1920’s, is has been stationnary since 1985 (AD Fuller p-value of 0.0002). </p>

						<h2>Revenue</h2>
						<p>As seen earlier, women make up a very small portion of writers and directors and the minority of main characters. Maybe it is because movies created by women or portraying them are less successful ? The CMU Movies dataset contains reliable revenue information. Hence, we studied the difference in the revenue for movies created by women or portraying them. It would be best to have a balanced dataset to do statistical tests. Hence a matching procedure on the budget, year of release, score and the genre of the movie has been done. As you can see in the following graphs, these features can have a big impact on the revenue. Budget is significantly correlated to revenue but not to the gender of the crew

						<h3>In terms of the gender crew</h3>
						<p>First, with raw distributions of revenue, movies made by a mixed crew do not seem to have smaller revenue, even though the highest grossing ones are made by men.  
						</p>
						<p>After matching, with a balanced dataset, the distributions have slightly changed. Indeed, the highest grossing movie is now created by a crew containing a woman. However, statistical show that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the distributions are different (Mann-Whitney U p-value of 0.9).
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/21/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>So, women do make successful movies, the reason for their absence in crews must come from something else.

						<h3>Prediction of the revenue</h3>
						<p>Finally, to tie this whole part, an ordinary least square regression has been computed to predict the revenue and look at the impact of each feature:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Main character white or not ?</li>
							<li>Gender of the main character ?</li>
							<li>Does the crew contain a woman ?</li>
							<li>Year of release</li>
							<li>Score </li>
							<li>Runtime </li>
							<li>Budget </li>
							<li>Genre of the movie (as categorical variable for each genre) </li>
						</ul>
						<p>The coefficients can give us information about the impact of one variable on the revenue. As we want statistically significant results, we only discuss coefficients that have a p-value under 0.05. The budget, year of release, runtime, genre_Action and genre_Animation have positive coefficients. Meaning that if they are bigger, the revenue is too. According to our model, to make a high grossing movie, you need to make a long animation or action movie with a big budget and release it now. 
						</p>
						<p>The resulting regression has a R-square value of 0.41, which means that some features that could explain the revenue better are missing. For instance, the notoriety of the actors.
