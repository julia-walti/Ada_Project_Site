							<h2> Context </h2>
							<p>The movie industry today is a caucasian man’s world but things are changing. There has been a debate in recent years whether cultural minorities 
								have been invisibilized in occidental cultural works, especially in American cinema. Moreover, with the rise of the MeToo movement and feminism in general, 
								the place of women in this industry has also been debated. Indeed, both these groups are often portrayed as stereotypical secondary characters and most 
								successful movies are often not portraying stories about these groups. Also, they are noticeably absent from the crews. 
								<a href="https://womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/the-history-and-future-of-women-in-film">[1]</a>
								<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/female-representation-in-movies-has-barely-changed-in-a-decade-but-theres-a-way-we-can-fix-it-9940849">[2]</a> 
								<a href="https://impakter.com/minority-recognition-in-film-where-is-the-diversity/">[3]</a>
								Hence, the place of minorities and women in movies will be studied in this project. This will be done in terms of presence, representation and success by 
								looking at actors, characters and crew members. With this, a timeline of the integration of these groups in the industry will be created, with which a time-series 
								analysis will be performed. It must be noted that the dataset used goes to the year 2013, and as many changes have been put in place since then, some might be
								missed as they happened recently. Moreover, during this project, gender will be looked as binary as it represented this way in the dataset.</p>

							<h2>The gender bias in movie plots</h2>
							<div id="test1"></div> 
							<p> To begin this project, the most recurrent adjectives, verbs (actions) for each character gender have been investigated. 
								We used some Natural Language Processing tools to analyze movie summaries. These tools can understand the names of characters and other words that describe them. We also extended the dataset with information about the gender and ethnicity of the characters. Then, we looked at which words were most commonly used to describe characters in different groups. 
							</p> 					
							<p>This is a word cloud of the most common words used to describe men and women :</p>
							<img src="images/gender_wordcloud_male.png" alt="" />
							<img src="images/gender_wordcloud_female.png" alt="" />
							<p>These words were grouped in different corresponding lexical fields :	</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/102/" height="2500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p> 
								As the most used lexical fields appear to be common for masculine and feminine characters, let’s compare the top 15 lexical fields to better see the differences in a Venn diagram :
							</p>
							<img src="images/gender-venn.png" alt="" />
							<p> 
								Most of the top lexical fields are common to the two genders, but the exclusive ones are quite striking : men are more associated with violent behavior words, while women are more associated with caring words.
							</p>
							<p>
								To try and see the differences further, every lexical field was compared between men and women to see which fields are used more for one than for the other :
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/104/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>
								Since the fields are ordered from most biased to least biased towards each gender, the first lexical fields could be described as clichés in American cinema. Men’s clichés are to be geeks, violent, dominant even, while women’s clichés are to be good-looking, emotional, and sexual.
							</p>
							<p>
								The lexical fields can then be ordered again by importance, while keeping the bias towards each gender :
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/106/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>
								While the left plot captures the absolute bias of the most important lexical fields, the right plot takes the rolling mean of biases. The fact that the rolling mean stays in the male zone for the most common lexical fields tends to indicate that the plots are mostly written about men, for the better and for the worse. This is consistent with the other findings of the study.

							<h2>The ethnicity bias in movie plots</h2>
							<div id="test1"></div> 
							<p>
								Next, the same anaylsis as before has been done but on the ethnicity of the characters. However, the categories had to be divided in ‘White’ and ‘Non-white’ to obtain accurate results, as all other ethnicities were far less represented.
							</p>
							<img src="images/ethnicity_wordcloud_white.png" alt="" />
							<img src="images/ethnicity_wordcloud_nonwhite.png" alt="" />
							
							<p> As for genders, the most important lexical fields were drawn for the two categories :</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/108/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p> At first, the most common lexical fields seem quite similar, with both groups sharing the top three lexical fields that are speaking, communication and traveling.</p>
							<p>The differences between the top 15 lexical fields were plotted in this Venn diagram :</p>
							<img src="images/ethnicities_venn.png" alt="" />
							<p>
								Again, most of the top lexical fields are common to both groups. For white characters, the exclusive fields seem surprising, being ‘dispute’, ‘wedding’ and ‘pain’. For Non-whites, criminal lexical fields appear to be characteristic.
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/110/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>
								Non-white biased lexical fields are mostly negatively connotated. They can be arranged in stereotypical themes : 
								<ul>
									<li> <b>mysticism</b>, containing ‘magic’, ‘monster’, ‘ancient’, ‘worship’;	</li>
									<li> <b>artistry</b> , containing ‘music’, ‘musical’, ‘dance’;	</li>
									<li> <b>incivilities</b> , containing ‘rage’, ‘monster’, ‘swearing_terms’</li>
								</ul>
								Notably, the field ‘feminine’ is high in the white-biased lexical fields, while ‘blue_collar_job’ is the second most non-white-biased field.
							</p>
							<p>When ordering by lexical field importance, the results are more surprising :</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/112/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>
								Indeed, looking at the plot on the right, the top fields are mostly in the non-white zone, but they are also quite negative: on the left plot, the most important fields that are non-white biased are ‘negative_emotion’, ‘fight’, ‘kill’ and ‘violence’, ‘aggression’ and ‘crime’. All The While, the top fields that are white-biased are way more positive, with ‘traveling’, ‘meeting’, ‘giving’, ‘family’ but also ‘dispute’. This strongly shows that American cinema depicts non-white people negatively, but also very often so.
								Unfortunately, movie summaries did not provide enough text to make a reliable time-series analysis for both gender and ethnicities, and stereotypical characters couldn’t be derived as some ethnicities were not represented enough.

							<h2>Are movies genres and gender of the lead role related?</h2>
							<p>Let’s see if  the gender of the main actor of a movie and its genre are correlated. We want to answer questions of the following type: “Are men more likely to star in Action movies than women?”. 
							Let us look at how many movies per movie genre we have in our dataset. 
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/35/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p> Some movie genres don’t have enough movies in our dataset for us to make reliable analysis or conclusions on them. Hence, for our analysis, we will drop the following movie genres: Family, Fantasy, History, Music, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction, Sport, Thriller, Western. Hence, the results of our study only apply to Action, Adventure, Animation, Biography, Comedy, Crime, Drama and Horror movies.
							</p>
							<p>Next, let us look at the relationship between the gender of the protagonist and the genre of the movie.								
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/68/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>	A first look at our data suggests male actors systematically have a higher shot at the lead role, regardless of the genre of the movie, with some contrasts depending upon which movie genre we look at. For example, for action movies, men are far more likely to have the lead role than women, whereas in drama movies, this difference is less pronounced.
							</p>
							<p>To dig a little deeper, we used statistical methods (chi square test) to determine if the correlation between the gender of the lead role and the genre of a movie exists. And if so, to which extent. 
							The correlation between the two was found to be significant. 								
							Without any correlation between the gender of the lead role and movies genre, men are expected to lead ≃ 75% of movies of all genres and women are expected to lead ≃ 25% of movies across all genres (because men are generally occupy the main role in movies more often than women overall). These are called the expected frequencies.
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/37/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>However, the observed values differ from this prediction. Here are the observed frequencies.
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/39/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>Let us visualize the difference between the observed and expected frequencies here:
							</p>
							<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/41/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
							<p>	The following observations can be made: </p>
							<ul>
								<li> <b>Drama Films:</b> In Drama films, women occupy the lead role ≃ 35% of the time and men ≃ 65% of the time. Compared with the expected values, this means American cinema is more likely to choose women as lead roles in Drama movies than men.					
								</li>
								<li> <b>Action Films:</b> In Action films, men occupy the lead role more than 90% of the time while women occupy it less than 10% of the time. Comparing this to the expected values, American cinema is more likely to choose men as their lead role in action movies than average.
								</li>
								<li> <b>Horror Films:</b> Horror films seem to do the best in terms of gender distribution of main roles. Women occupy the lead role 44% of the tie while men occupy it 55% of the time. Comparing this to the expected values, Horror movies are much more likely to portray women than men compared to average.
								</li>
							</ul>

						<h2>Proportion of women in the crew </h2>
						<p>Next, let’s look at the proportion of women writers and directors. There are a lot of directors and writers for one movie. In the dataset used, 94, 02 % of movies were directed and 95,80 % written by only men. There were no movies that were written or directed by only women. If we merge the crew information, there are 7,78 % movies that have at least one woman in the crew.
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/13/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>Thus, with no surprise, the distributions of movies created by only men or by a crew containing at least one women are significantly different (Mann-Whitney p-value of 5e-20). Moreover, even if the proportion of women in movie crews has change since the 1920’s, is has been stationnary since 1985 (AD Fuller p-value of 0.0002). </p>

						<h2>Revenue</h2>
						<p>As seen earlier, women make up a very small portion of writers and directors and the minority of main characters. Maybe it is because movies created by women or portraying them are less successful ? The CMU Movies dataset contains reliable revenue information. Hence, we studied the difference in the revenue for movies created by women or portraying them. It would be best to have a balanced dataset to do statistical tests. Hence a matching procedure on the budget, year of release, score and the genre of the movie has been done.

						<h3>In terms of main character gender</h3>
						<p>	We know that men are far more likely to play the lead role in American movies. Now let’s see if there is a noticeable difference in the revenue of a movie based on the gender of its protagonist. Do movies portraying men make more than movies portraying women? 		
						</p>
						<p> If we first look at our raw dataset, movies portraying women gross about 58’000’000 USD, and movies portraying men gross about 85’000’000 USD. This suggests that movies portraying women earn 68% less at the box office…
						</p>
						<p>
							The difference forementioned is statistically significant. However, does this difference really solely have to do with the gender of the protagonist? 
							Other hidden factors could be behind this difference, as shown earlier, we know that women are more likely to star in Horror, Drama and Comedy movies, but less likely to star in Action, Crime, or Animation movies.  So this difference in revenue might actually come from the fact that men and women don’t star in the same kind of movies. Maybe movies starring men make more just because Action movies make more? 
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/61/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>
							The difference observed could also be due to the budget of the movie. Movies with higher budgets earn higher revenue. And as we can see, movies with male protagonists start with a higher budget than those with a female protagonist. This could be another confounding factor in your analysis. 
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/59/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>
							The difference could also be due to the year of release of a movie. Movies released more recently have a higher budget and hence a higher revenue. And as we can see, women are more likely to star in recent films and than older films. This factor could have a difference in our analysis as well. 
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/57/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>
							The difference in revenue could also be due to the score of the movie in question. As we can see, movies starring men often have a bit higher score than movies starring women. 
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/55/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p> 
							So in order to do this analysis properly, we have to compare movies starring men and women with the same genre, similar budget, score and year of release to determine whether or not gender of the protagonist in itself has an effect on an American movie’s earnings.
							Once these parameters are adjusted, we see that it is actually the opposite. After balancing the factors mentioned before (using propensity score matching), it turns out that hiring a woman for the starring role might actually make you more money than hiring a man!
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/63/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p> 
							Movies starring women make 69 million USD on average and movies starring men make 62 million dollars on average. That’s 11% more and statistically significant.

						<h3>In terms of the gender crew</h3>
						<p>First, with raw distributions of revenue, movies made by a mixed crew do not seem to have smaller revenue, even though the highest grossing ones are made by men.  
						</p>
						<p>After the same matching procedure as before, with a balanced dataset, the distributions have slightly changed. Indeed, the highest grossing movie is now created by a crew containing a woman. However, statistical show that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the distributions are different (Mann-Whitney U p-value of 0.9).
						</p>
						<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~DataSIEences/21/" height="500" width="1000"></iframe>
						<p>So, women do make successful movies, the reason for their absence in crews must come from something else.
